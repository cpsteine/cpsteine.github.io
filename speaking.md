I often speak on technology, algorithms and big data -- and how these latter two forces have come to shape, change and rule our lives. 

​Please email me at chris AT chrissteiner DOT com if you're interested in having me speak at your event. 

In addition to the events below, I have appeared on The Today Show, The Colbert Report, ABC, CNN, Fox News (always the most fun, love the yelling), CNBC, NPR's Morning Edition, Marketplace and Talk of the Nation, among others.

How do you make sense of a world that is constantly changing? How do you solve problems that haven’t been defined? We are faced with a future that holds growing political, economic, and environmental uncertainty.

Advertising is changing at a pace so rapid that both sides, buy and sell, never have a clear view of how to plan for the next year.

Automation via the force of dominant algorithms is changing advertising. Harness their power or be left behind.
